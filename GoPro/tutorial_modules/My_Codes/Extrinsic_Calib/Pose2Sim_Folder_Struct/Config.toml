# # Configure your project parameters here. 
# # 
# # IMPORTANT:
# # If a parameter is not found here, Pose2Sim will look for its value in the 
# # Config.toml file of the level above. This way, you can set global 
# # instructions for the Session and alter them for specific Participants or Trials.
# #
# # If you wish to overwrite a parameter for a specific trial or participant,  
# # edit its Config.toml file by uncommenting its key (e.g., [project])
# # and editing its value (e.g., frame_range = [10,300]). Or else, uncomment 
# # [filtering.butterworth] and set cut_off_frequency = 10, etc.

# ## If cameras are not synchronized, designates the frame range of the camera with the shortest recording time
# ## N.B.: If you want a time range instead, use frame_range = time_range * frame_rate
